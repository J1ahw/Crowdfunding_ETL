# Crowdfunding_ETL

In this mini project we built an ETL pipeline using Python and regular expressions to extract and transform data.\n
We created four csv files (contact, campaign, category and subcategory)\n
then used this to create and ERD and table schema\n
finally uploading into a Postgres database called crowdfunding_db.
